    "step0": "Examine the scene for any obvious hazards. In some cases, it may not be safe to perform CPR. If there are any dangers nearby preventing you from getting close to the person, don’t endanger your own life as well as theirs. Call emergency services and wait for help to arrive.",
    "step1": "Check for unresponsiveness. If an adult or teen collapses but remains conscious, CPR is not typically needed. If they lose consciousness and are not breathing, however, you should administer rescue breaths if possible, or stick to hands-only CPR if you’re not trained in doing rescue breathing. If they’re not breathing, have no pulse, and are unresponsive, try to perform some form of CPR even if you are untrained or rusty in your abilities.",

    "step2": "Call the Emergency Services. If you find a person who is unresponsive, isn’t breathing, or doesn’t have a pulse and you decide to do some form of CPR, you should still immediately call your local emergency number before you do anything else. CPR can revive people on occasion, but it should be viewed as buying time until emergency personnel arrive with appropriate equipment.",

    "step3": "Keep the victim on their back. In order to perform hands-only CPR, the victim should be positioned on their back (supine), preferably on a firm surface, with the head facing up. If the person is on their side or stomach (prone), then gently roll them onto their back while trying to support their head and neck. Try to make note if the person experienced significant trauma while falling and becoming unconscious.",

    "step4": "Tilt the person’s chin up to open their airway. Once you have them on their back, tilt their head back while pressing their chin up and forward with 2 fingers. This should move their tongue out of the way and make it easier for them to breathe.",

    "step5": "Rapidly push down on the center of the chest. Place one hand directly over the center of the person's chest (between their nipples, generally) and your other hand on top of the first for reinforcement. Press down on the victim's chest firmly and quickly—aim for about 100 chest compressions a minute until paramedics arrive.",
