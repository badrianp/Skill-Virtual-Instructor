    "step1": "Follow the same initial procedures as hands-only CPR. Even if you have recent CPR training and are confident of your abilities, you still need to assess the person to see if they are responsive. Move them onto their back if they are not responsive and show no sign of neck, head, or spine injury. Try to call emergency services before starting chest compressions and look for someone to trade off with.",

    "step2": "Proceed to open the airway. If you're trained in CPR, confident of your abilities (not rusty), and you've performed 30 chest compressions, then proceed to open the person's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift technique, or the jaw-thrust if you suspect a neck/head/spine injury. Put your palm on their forehead and gently tilt (extend) their head back a little. Then, with your other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open up their airway, making it easier to give them oxygen.",
    "img2": "cpradult4",
    "step3": "Place your mouth over the victim's mouth. Once the person's head is tilted and their chin lifted, make sure their mouth is free of any objects blocking their airway. Then, use one hand to pinch the victim's nostrils closed and cover their mouth completely with your own mouth. Form a seal with your mouth so that no air can escape while you attempt to give the victim a rescue breath.",
    "img3": "cprbreath1",
    "step4": "Start with 2 rescue breaths. Once your mouth is over the other person's, forcefully breathe into their mouth for at least 1 full second and watch their chest to determine if it rises a little or not. If it does, give the second breath. If it doesn't, then repeat the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver and try again. Don't be too timid or grossed out, because a person's life is in your hands.",
    "img4": "cprbreath2",
    "step5": "Repeat cycles as needed. Follow the 2 rescue breaths with another round of 30 chest compressions and 2 more rescue breaths. Repeat as needed until the victim becomes responsive or until emergency medical personnel can take over. Remember that chest compressions attempt to restore some sort of circulation, while the rescue breathing provides some (but not much) oxygen to prevent tissues, particularly the brain, from dying.",
