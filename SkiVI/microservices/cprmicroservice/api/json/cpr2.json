    "step1": "Assess the situation to figure out if their airway is blocked. The most common cause of infant suffocation is choking. You need to assess the situation to determine if the airway is completely blocked or only partially blocked.",

    "step2": "Call the Emergency Services. A child who is unresponsive, isn’t breathing, or doesn’t have a pulse and you decide to do some form of CPR, you should still immediately call your local emergency number before you do anything else. CPR, especially on children is quite dangerous as children aren't as strong as adults, so it's better left for the ones that are advanced in it",

    "step3": "Position the baby between your forearms. Position the baby so that they are face-up on 1 forearm. Cradle the back of their head with the hand of the same forearm. Place your other forearm over the baby's front and gently turn them over so that they are face-down, remaining sandwiched in between your arms the entire time.",
    "img3": "cprchild2",
    "step4": "Deliver back blows to dislodge an airway obstruction. Use the heel of your dominant hand to deliver 5 gentle yet distinct back blows in between the baby's shoulder blades.",
    "img4": "cprchild3",
    "step5": "Place the baby on their back. After delivering the gentle back blows, place your free hand on the back of the baby's head, resting your arm firmly along the baby's spine. Carefully turn the baby back over so they are face-up again.",
    "img5": "cprchild4",
    "step6": "Position your fingers in the center of the baby's chest. Position the tips of 2 or 3 fingers in the center of the baby's chest while supporting the baby's neck and head with your other hand. Use your thumb and fingers to hold the jaw as you sandwich the baby in between your forearms. The lower arm should support the baby's back on your opposite thigh, and the baby's head should be lower than the rest of their body.",
    "img6": "cprchild5",
    "step7": "Gently compress the chest. Push straight down on the chest, depressing it by about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). If the baby is conscious, only perform 5 compressions. If the baby is unconscious, perform 30 compressions.",
    "img7": "cprchild6",
    "step8": "Cover the baby's nose and mouth and breathe. You do not need to pinch the nose plugged as you would do with an adult. Instead, seal off the baby's breathing passages by placing your entire mouth over their nose and mouth. Make sure to wipe away any vomit, blood, mucus, or saliva first.",
    "img8": "cprchild7",
    "step9": "Repeat the cycle as needed. Repeat chest compressions and rescue breaths as needed until the baby begins to breathe again or until emergency medical professionals arrive.",
