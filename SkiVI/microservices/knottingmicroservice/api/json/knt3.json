    "description": "The Clove Hitch is a knot that is used to secure things to rods or poles. Such as tying a hammock line to a tree, start and end lashings, making a a ladder out of sticks, and any other task that you would need to secure a rope to a pole or rod. This knot is most often used when starting and ending lashings, but it can be used in other circumstances as I described.",
    "step1": "1. Loop the working end around the rod one turn.",
    "img1": "clove1",
    "img2": "clove2",
    "step2": "2. Loop around the rod again, but this time in the opposite direction of the loop in step one.",
    "img3": "clove3",
    "img4": "clove4",
    "step3": "3. Thread the working end of the rope under the crossing made by going from the first loop to the second.",
    "img5": "clove5",
    "step4": "4. Pull tight and the knot is finished.",

    "afterword": "To untie this knot; move the two loops away from each other to loosen the knot. Now pull the knot apart and the Clove Hitch is untied. Another way to do this is to widen the 'X' until the knot is loose enough to pull apart."
