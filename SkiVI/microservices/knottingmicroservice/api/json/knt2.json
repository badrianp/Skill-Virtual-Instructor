    "description": "The Surgeon Knot is a variant of the Square knot used when tension needs to be kept in the rope while the knot is being tied. If you are hanging a hammock and one side is already hanging, then you can use a surgeon knot to tie the other other side and keep tension in the rope without having to hold up the hammock. You could use the Surgeon Knot to tie any two pieces of rope that are under tension, or whenever you would use a Square Knot, but want to make sure the knot will not come untied.",
    "step1": "1. Start the same as the Square Knot, but do an additional cross. Cross the right working end over, then under the left standing end twice. Switch the hands the ends are held in.",

    "afterword": "Untie a Surgeon Knot the same way you would a Square Knot. Simply pull on the two bights. In the reference pictures, these are on the left (white rope) and right (green rope) turn back on themselves making a bight."
